Creating a smart budget tracker that uses machine learning to analyze spending patterns and optimize monthly budgets is a multifaceted project. Below is a simple version of a complete Python program to get you started. This example uses basic structures and mock data to simulate behavior. For a real-world application, you would need to integrate real data inputs, robust machine learning models, and enhanced data preprocessing, among other things.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Mock Data Creation: Replace this with real data fetching or reading mechanism
def create_mock_data():
    categories = ['Groceries', 'Utilities', 'Rent', 'Entertainment', 'Transport', 'Misc']
    num_samples = 100
    data = {
        'Month': pd.date_range(start='1/1/2021', periods=num_samples, freq='M'),
        'Category': np.random.choice(categories, num_samples),
        'Amount': np.random.uniform(50, 1500, num_samples)
    }
    return pd.DataFrame(data)

# Function to preprocess the data
def preprocess_data(df):
    # Encode categorical variables
    df['Category'] = df['Category'].astype('category').cat.codes
    return df

# Function to train a Random Forest Model
def train_model(X, y):
    error_message = "Model training failed"
    try:
        model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
        model.fit(X, y)
        return model
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"{error_message}: {e}")
        return None

# Function to predict spending
def predict_spending(model, X):
    error_message = "Prediction failed"
    try:
        predictions = model.predict(X)
        return predictions
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"{error_message}: {e}")
        return None

# Function to calculate and print the budget recommendation
def budget_recommendation(predictions, categories):
    error_message = "Failed to compute budget recommendations"
    try:
        total_spending = sum(predictions)
        recommended_budget = total_spending * 0.95  # Example: Suggest decreasing total spending by 5%
        print(f"Recommended Monthly Budget: ${recommended_budget:.2f}")
        print("Suggested savings by category:")
        savings_suggestion = 0.05 * predictions
        for category, savings in zip(categories, savings_suggestion):
            print(f"{category}: Save ${savings:.2f}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"{error_message}: {e}")

# Main function
def main():
    # Create and preprocess mock data
    print("Creating and preprocessing data...")
    data = create_mock_data()
    data = preprocess_data(data)

    # Split data into training and testing sets
    print("Splitting data into training and testing sets...")
    X = data[['Month', 'Category']]
    y = data['Amount']
    
    try:
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Data splitting failed: {e}")
        return

    # Train model
    print("Training model...")
    model = train_model(X_train, y_train)
    if model is None:
        return

    # Predict spending
    print("Predicting spending...")
    predictions = predict_spending(model, X_test)
    if predictions is None:
        return

    # Analyze and recommend budget
    print("Analyzing and recommending budget...")
    budget_recommendation(predictions, data['Category'].unique())

    # Bonus: Plot the predicted vs actual values
    try:
        plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
        plt.plot(y_test.values, label='Actual')
        plt.plot(predictions, label='Predicted')
        plt.legend()
        plt.title("Actual vs Predicted Spending")
        plt.xlabel("Sample Index")
        plt.ylabel("Amount ($)")
        plt.show()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to plot predictions: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:

- **Data Creation**: For now, mock data is created for demonstration. You'll need to integrate with a data source for real applications.
- **Preprocessing**: Categorical data (spending categories) needs to be encoded numerically.
- **Model Training**: A Random Forest Regressor is used to predict the spending amounts.
- **Error Handling**: There are `try-except` blocks to catch and display errors without stopping the execution abruptly.
- **Budget Recommendations**: Based on predictions, it suggests a reduced budget.

For a production-ready software, consider incorporating a user interface, secure storage, personalized ML models, and more sophisticated error handling and logging mechanisms.
